# Building the SBOM tool from source.

The SBOM tool is a cross-platform tool written in C# and is compiled using .NET Core 3.1. Follow the instructions below to build the tool from source.

## Prerequisites
* Please download and install [Dotnet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1) version 3.1.300 or greater.
* Clone this GitHub repo (See steps to clone repo [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
* A text editor or IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

## Understanding the source structure

All the source code for the tool lives in the `src` folder, and the tests in the `test` folder. The core engine that drives the sbom tool to generate SBOMs lives in the `Microsoft.Sbom.Api` project. 

The code is designed to be as extensible as possible and all the interfaces that can be use to extend the SBOM tool are placed in the `Microsoft.Sbom.Extensions` project. Once such extension is the `IManifestGenerator` interface. The SBOM tool uses this interface to serialize a SBOM to a specific format, in our case, the `Microsoft.Sbom.Parsers.Spdx22SbomParser` project implements this interface and allows the SBOM tool to serialize a SBOM to specifically the SPDX 2.2 format. The extensions project has additional interfaces that are used to extend the SBOM tool.

The `Microsoft.Sbom.Common` project contains any common code, constants, etc that are used by all the projects in this solution.

The `Microsoft.Sbom.Contracts` project defines the interfaces that are used to call the SBOM tool through a C# API. The `ISBOMGenerator` class defines two methods that can be used to directly call the SBOM tool from C# code directly. The `Microsoft.Sbom.Tool` project defines a CLI interface to talk to the SBOM tool.

### Package management using a public ADO feed

The SBOM tool project uses the **SBOMToolPublic** feed as a package source to pull the required packages that are used to build the tool. The feed is a public Azure Artifacts feed, and can be accessed without authentication.

All the packages that are needed to build the SBOM tool are already present in the feed, and most of the time you shouldn't have any issues pulling these packages from the feed. Occasionally, you might be building for a new environment that might require some additional packages that are not in the feed, in this case your build will fail as it won't be able to pull the required packages. If you are in this situation, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool/issues) with the package and version for which the build failed. We will manually add those pacakges to the feed to unblock you right away.

In the future, we will remove this feed and directly consume packages from nuget.org, when that happens, this additional steps won't be needed.

## Building on Visual Studio 

Start Visual Studio 2022, and open the Microsoft.Sbom.sln file in the root of the repository. You can press `Ctrl + Shift + b` or select Build from the menu to build the application.

1. Set the Microsoft.Sbom.Tool project as the startup project (rightclick-> Set as Startup Project)
1. Set Run arguments for the Microsoft.Sbom.Tool project (rightclick->properties->Debug)  
	*Minimum:* `generate -b <drop path> -bc <build components path> -pn <package name> -pv <package version> -nsb <namespace uri base>`
1. Now, any time you make a change, you can press `F5`. This will build the changes, and start the process in debug mode (hitting any breakpoints you set)

You can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC3CJcYxkl0&t=31s) small tutorial to get started with Visual Studio.

## Building on the command line

Go to the shell of your choice, make sure that the Dotnet SDK is installed and available on the `PATH` for the shell. Navigate to the root of the repository and execute the following command to build the repository.

```
dotnet build
```

You can run the tool using this minimal command

```
dotnet run --project src/Microsoft.Sbom.Tool generate -- -b <drop path> -bc <build components path> -pn <package name> -pv <package version> -nsb <namespace uri base>
```

## Building using Codespaces

If you have access to [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces), select the `Code` button from the [repository homepage](https://github.com/microsoft/sbom-tool) then select `Open with Codespaces`. That's it! You have a full developer environment that supports debugging, testing, auto complete, jump to definition, everything you would expect.
