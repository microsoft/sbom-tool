Actions

  Validate -options - Validate a build artifact using the manifest. Optionally also verify the signing certificate of the manifest.

    Option                   Description
    BuildDropPath (-b)       The root folder of the drop directory to validate.
    ManifestDirPath (-m)     The path of the directory where the manifest will be validated. If this parameter is not specified, the manifest will be validated in {BuildDropPath}/_manifest directory.
    OutputPath (-o)          The path where the output json should be written. ex: Path/output.json
    CatalogFilePath (-C)     This parameter is deprecated and will not be used, we will automatically detect the catalog file using our standard directory structure. The path of signed catalog file that is
                             used to verify the signature of the manifest json file.
    ValidateSignature (-s)   If set, will validate the manifest using the signed catalog file.
    IgnoreMissing (-im)      If set, will not fail validation on the files presented in Manifest but missing on the disk.
    FailIfNoPackages (-n)    If set, validation will fail if there are no packages detected in the sbom.
    RootPathFilter (-r)      If you're downloading only a part of the drop using the '-r' or 'root' parameter in the drop client, specify the same string value here in order to skip validating paths that are
                             not downloaded.
    HashAlgorithm (-Ha)      The Hash algorithm to use while verifying or generating the hash value of a file
    Verbosity (-V)           Display this amount of detail in the logging output.

                             Fatal
    Parallelism (-P)         The number of parallel threads to use for the workflows.
    ConfigFilePath (-Co)     The json file that contains the configuration for the DropValidator.
    TelemetryFilePath (-t)   Specify a file where we should write detailed telemetry for the workflow.
    FollowSymlinks (-F)      If set to false, we will not follow symlinks while traversing the build drop folder. Default is set to 'true'.
    ManifestInfo (-mi)       A list of the name and version of the manifest format that we are using.

  Generate -options - Generate a SBOM for all the files in the given build drop folder, and the packages in the components path.

    Option                                    Description
    BuildDropPath (-b)                        The root folder of the drop directory for which the SBOM file will be generated.
    BuildComponentPath (-bc)                  The folder containing the build components and packages.
    BuildListFile (-bl)                       The file path to a file containing a list of files one file per line for which the SBOM file will be generated. Only files listed in the file will be included in
                                              the generated SBOM.
    ManifestDirPath (-m)                      The path of the directory where the generated SBOM files will be placed. A folder named '_manifest' will be created at this location, where all generated SBOMs
                                              will be placed. If this parameter is not specified, the files will be placed in {BuildDropPath}/_manifest directory.
    PackageName (-pn)                         The name of the package this SBOM represents. If this is not provided, we will try to infer this name from the build that generated this package, if that also
                                              fails, the SBOM generation fails.
    PackageVersion (-pv)                      The version of the package this SBOM represents. If this is not provided, we will try to infer the version from the build that generated this package, if that also
                                              fails, the SBOM generation fails.
    PackageSupplier (-ps)                     Supplier of the package that this SBOM represents.
    DockerImagesToScan (-di)                  Comma separated list of docker image names or hashes to be scanned for packages, ex: ubuntu:16.04, 56bab49eef2ef07505f6a1b0d5bd3a601dfc3c76ad4460f24c91d6fa298369ab.
    AdditionalComponentDetectorArgs (-cd)     Additional set of arguments for Component Detector.  An appropriate usage of this would be a space-delimited list of `--key value` pairs, representing command-line arguments. See the component-detection repository for a list of valid arguments (https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection/blob/main/docs/detector-arguments.md).
                                              switches.
    ExternalDocumentReferenceListFile (-er)   The path to a file containing a list of external SBOMs that will be included as external document reference in the output SBOM. SPDX 2.2 is the only supported
                                              format for now.
    NamespaceUriUniquePart (-nsu)             A unique valid URI part that will be appended to the SPDX SBOM namespace URI. This value should be globally unique.
    NamespaceUriBase (-nsb)                   The base path of the SBOM namespace URI.
    GenerationTimestamp (-gt)                 A timestamp in the format 'yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ' that will be used as the generated timestamp for the SBOM.
    DeleteManifestDirIfPresent (-D)           If set to true, we will delete any previous manifest directories that are already present in the ManifestDirPath without asking the user for confirmation. The new
                                              manifest directory will then be created at this location and the generated SBOM will be stored there.
    FetchLicenseInformation (-li)             If set to true, we will attempt to fetch license information of packages detected in the SBOM from the ClearlyDefinedApi.
    EnablePackageMetadataParsing (-pm)        If set to true, we will attempt to parse license and supplier info from the packages metadata file (RubyGems, NuGet, Maven, Npm).
    Verbosity (-V)                            Display this amount of detail in the logging output.
